# EyeSearchApp
A quicker way to Google search for those rich snippets results when looking for a key-word.

It can be any text of any type and anywhere as long as it can be highlighted by mouse-drag and you've got internet access.

The way it works is:
  
1.start app - you have two modes that you can choose from:
  - a standard Windows like mode:

  - a frameless/borderless way - note in this way you'll not be able to move the app around or to resize, you can only minimise the app in the taskbar:

  -note the state of the restart/ window toggle button keeps its state

2.to select the text you can use CTRL(hold) + LMB(drag) - take you're time to do it right - the app will copy the key-word/s only after CTRL was released.

3.the app uses web-scraping to get the rich snippet text back from the result and into the app - atm every time you search for a new key-word the app will refresh with the newly searched result.

4.the app allows for copy/paste in the text-window.

Personal preferance: 
  The way I use it is by having it minimised in the taskbar when going through my day - having it active once started it will always listen for the keys set-up to start the process.
  
The keys selected are a combo of keyboard + mouse so in this case you'd need to use CTRL + LMB - these seem a rare combination to be used when workin with the usual office tools but feel free to make you're own mods.

The app has several widgets like the restart/ window toggle button, the status of the actions, a progress bar and a counter for the "allowed" KWPH(missing implementation atm - counter works though) and is conected with a Remaining Time couter(60minutes) in the lower-left area along with a clock, also an ESC button with a See you later animation for when exiting the app.

Have Fun!
